 We are a team of students who strongly oppose the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and we are committed to raising awareness about the war in Ukraine and the repercussions in Russia. We aim to provide verified information and to keep a database of reliable foundations that are collecting donations to help Ukrainian refugees. We envision our contribution would be building a deeper understanding of this humanitarian crisis, supporting affected students, and promoting peace.
