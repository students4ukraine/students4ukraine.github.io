  Our student group was founded in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, 2022. Our team strongly condemns the war, and our mission is to deepen the understanding of the conflict and to connect Princeton students with Ukraine relief volunteering and civic engagement opportunities. 

## Our initiatives in the Fall 2022 include:

- supporting Ukraine relief efforts through fundraising; 
- issuing a weekly newsletter to raise awareness about **Russian anti-war activism** and current events. You may sign up for our **weekly newsletter** [here](https://forms.gle/kY3LTwPGRWYfmVjC6). Our newsletter covers recent news from both Ukraine and Russia concerning the war. We also write about ways to support Ukraine and announce our events on campus.
- offering tutoring and mentorship to a group of talented Ukrainian student refugees;
- organising educational events: talks, trips and discussions. 


Previously, we also organized **a series of talks** with prominent anti-war public figures who were actively supporting Ukraine relief efforts. In addition, we've partnered with Princeton's Music Department on organizing **four charitable concerts** to donate to a non-profit that supports Ukrainian refugees.
