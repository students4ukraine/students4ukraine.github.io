title: Student efforts at Princeton
---



- We **founded a new student organization at Princeton**, named after the date of the invasion, 02.24.2022. We would like to raise awareness of the war in Ukraine and the accompanying repercussions in Russia. We envision our contribution on campus would be building a deeper understanding of this humanitarian crisis and supporting Ukrainian refugees.
- We run a weekly newsletter. You may sign up for our **weekly newsletter** [here](https://forms.gle/kY3LTwPGRWYfmVjC6). Our newsletter covers recent news from both Ukraine and Russia concerning the war. We also write about ways to support Ukraine and announce our events on campus.
- We organized **a series of talks** with prominent anti-war public figures who are actively supporting Ukraine relief efforts.
- We've partnered with Princeton's Music Department on organizing **four charitable concerts** to donate to [Cash for Refugees](https://www.cashforrefugees.org).
