title: Student efforts at Princeton
---



- We **founded a new student organization at Princeton**, named after the date of invasion, 02.24.2022. We would like to raise awareness of the war in Ukraine and the accompanying repercussions in Russia. We aim to provide verified information and encourage donations to [Cash for Refugees](https://www.cashforrefugees.org), an initiative that directly helps Ukrainian refugees. We envision our contribution on campus would be building a deeper understanding of this humanitarian crisis, supporting affected students, and promoting peace.
- We run a weekly newsletter. You may sign up for our **weekly newsletter** [here](https://forms.gle/kY3LTwPGRWYfmVjC6). Our newsletter covers recent news from both Ukraine and Russia concerning the war. We also write about ways to support Ukraine and announce our events on campus.
- We organize **a series of talks** with prominent Russian investors, entrepreneurs, scholars, and politicians who are actively supporting anti-war movements and Ukraine relief efforts.
- Weâ€™'ve partnered with Princeton's Music Department on organizing **four charitable concerts** to donate to [Cash for Refugees](https://www.cashforrefugees.org).
